# hangman.
Java implementation of hangman

My first implementation of a hangman code is in hangman.java along with hangman.in

I've created another, more recent, code of hangman with the HangmanManager.java along with the HangmanMain.java as the driver. There are two dictionarys that can be used for this hangman implementation. *more information to come*
